    <p class="para"> My favourite hobby is reading. Last year in 2020, the whole world was stuck inside their homes. In that time and even now after my online classes I sit down in our library and go on reading for hours. I specially like to read at night before going to bed beacuse then I always have nice dreams and sleep soundly till morning. I am 10 years old and study in 5th class. Reading is a very nice thing as it relaxes your mind and helps to cultivate imagination and curosity inside you.It makes us loyal,punctual and disiplined too.
